								<h3>Manufacturing & Operations Intern</h3>
								<p>While working for UFP Technologies in Chicopee, MA, I was able to support the manufacturing team 
									by analyzing production data and implementing process improvements. The majority of my work
									focused on reducing waste and increasing efficiency on the production floor.

								<h3>Ball Bearing Sorter, ASME</h3>
								<p>Second year supporting the ASME Mechatronics Team at UMass. This year, I was on the mechanical sub-assembly squad,
									and helped design and manufacture the frame, hopper, and size-sorter for the robot. The constraints of the competition were
									to keep the assembly as small as possible, while still being able to sort and count as many ball bearings of different size and color
									as possible within a specified time limit.

								<h3>Mechanical Engineering Research Assistant</h3>
								<p>Working with Professor Modarres-Sadeghi in UMass' FSI Laboratory, I've began work on my senior-year Honors Thesis:
									"An Investigation of Coupled-Mode Flutter Within Small-Scale Wind Turbine Blades." <a href="images/work/U3.5.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #0074D9 !important;">This video</a>
									shows flow contacting the cross-section of my current blade design. As of now, I'm working on setting up the experimental apparatus to begin testing in the wind tunnel.

								<h3>Golf Robot, ASME</h3>
								<p>Collaborated with 15 peers to build a remote-controlled robot capable of traversing unique obstacles as well as chipping and 
									putting a golf ball to complete a pre-set miniature golf course. Worked throughout the academic year to design,
									prototype, and manufacture the robot, as well as support the electrical team, who programmed the microcontroller to operate the robot's various systems.

								<a href="images/projects/wrench.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/projects/wrench.jpg" alt="Multifunctional Wrench" /></a>
								<h3>Multifunctional Bike Wrench</h3>
								<p>Collaborated in a team of four to design an ultra-lightweight multifunctional bike wrench using CAD modeling and FEA 
									analysis (Ansys) to optimize strength and performance. We then manufactured the wrench, transforming aluminum stock through precision
									milling, drilling, and finishing techniques. Tested the final product in a live demonstration and delivered a comprehensive 
									presentation detailing the design process and engineering outcomes.</p>

								<h3>Obstacle-Avoiding "SmartCar"</h3>
								<p>Assembled a smart car powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller that could detect and avoid obstacles as needed. The build utilized distance sensors and basic
									collision-avoidance algorithms, enabling the car to change directions when faced with a blocked path. The car was programmed to move forward when there nothing was 
									directly in its way, and to turn when something was. This pathing allowed the car to avoid being obstructed by objects in its environment.

								<h3>Dynamic Analysis Walkthrough</h3>
								<p>This project featured a dynamic analysis of a two-link arm system, modeled using MATLAB. Lagrangian mechanics were employed to derive 
									the equations of motion, which were then solved numerically to simulate the system's behavior over time. The analysis provided insights into the arm's 
									kinematics and dynamics. The results were visualized through plots and animations, and I detailed the steps along the way, creating a comprehensive written walkthrough.

								<h3>Optimized Plywood Box Layout</h3>
								<p>
									This project focused on maximizing material efficiency by optimizing the layout of boxes cut from a standard 96" x 48" plywood sheet. 
									Using MATLAB, I implemented a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the optimal arrangement and maximize the number of boxes produced while minimizing waste. 
									The results were visualized through graphical outputs, providing clear insights into the effectiveness of the optimization strategy.

								<h3>Crankshaft Design Specification</h3>
								<p>Worked collaboratively with a team of six to author a detailed paper on the design and material selection for an automotive engine crankshaft. The project 
									emphasized the selection of quenched and tempered 4140 steel for its superior strength and fatigue resistance, and detailed the forging process and fatigue analysis 
									techniques used to optimize both performance and durability.</p>

								<h3>Tensile Testing Experiment</h3>
								<p>This lab report details an experiment on the tensile properties of 1010 Steel, investigating its mechanical response under tensile loading. The study employed hardness 
									and tensile tests to determine key parameters such as ultimate tensile strength, yield stress, and ductility. Worked in a GROUP lab environment to subject multiple steel specimen
									to relevant tensile tests, and then individually reported the findings.</p>
